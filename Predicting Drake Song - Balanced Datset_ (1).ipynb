I'm the greatest of my generation Like I should be dressing different Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us Like I didn't study the game to the letter And understand that I'm not doin' it the same Man, I'm doing it better Like I didn't make that clearer this year Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that They should put a couple more mirrors in here So I can stare at myself These are usually just some thoughts That I would share with myself But I thought \"Fuck it\", it's worth it to share 'em With someone else other than Paris for once I text her from time to time, she a mom now I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down I told her she could live with me if she need to I got a compound but I think she's straight 'Cause she supported since Hot Beats Right before Wayne came and got me Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory He walked right past in the hallway Three months later, I'm his artist He probably wouldn't remember that story But that shit stick with me always Couldn't believe when he called me You never know, it could happen to you And I just spent four Ferrari's all on a brand new Bugatti And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg Nothing was the same, dawg\"\"\"] \n",
